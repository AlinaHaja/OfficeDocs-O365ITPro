# Understand subscriptions and licenses in Office 365 for business

This article explains the relationship between subscriptions and licenses, and provides additional information about [who can assign licenses](#find-out-who-can-assign-licenses), [understanding what happens when you assign a license to someone](#understand-what-happens-when-you-assign-a-license-to-someone), and [how many devices can people install Office on](#how-many-devices-can-people-install-office-on). It also includes links to [understanding licenses for non-user mailboxes](#understand-licenses-for-non-user-mailboxes), and [Articles about managing licenses](#articles-about-managing-licenses).
  
When you buy a subscription to Office 365 for business, you sign up for a set of applications and services that you pay for on a monthly or annual basis.

When someone leaves your organization, you can remove a license from that person, and assign it to a different person.

To the right is a large orange user icon with a plus sign and an arrow pointing to it, indicating that it is replacing the one that was removed.](../media/2c3b5473-72eb-42c3-afe6-6eee2f3a2b0d.png)
  
If you have more than one subscription, you can assign licenses to different people for each subscription.
