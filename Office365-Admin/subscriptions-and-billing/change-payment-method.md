# Change your payment method for Office 365 for business

::: moniker range="o365-worldwide"

When you buy Office 365 for business, you choose to pay by credit card or bank account, pay by invoice, or pay by using a prepaid product key. You can switch between paying by credit card or bank account and paying by invoice at any time during your subscription. If you paid using a prepaid product key, you can choose to switch over to paying by credit card or bank account, or to paying by invoice after your licensing period has ended. After you switch payment methods, your users will continue to have the same license assignments as before.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Paying by using a bank account is not available in Japan. 
  
 **Want to change your payment frequency?** If you want to change how frequently you pay for your subscription, either from annual to monthly or monthly to annual, you'll need to [call Office 365 support](../contact-support-for-business-products.md) for help. 
  
 **Just want to change your credit card or bank account information?** See [Add, update, or remove a credit card or bank account in Office 365 for business](add-update-or-remove-credit-card-or-bank-account.md).
  
 **What if I have an outstanding balance?**
  
If you're moving from *invoice to credit card or bank account*, your existing invoice charges won't be transferred to your credit card or bank account, so be sure to pay any outstanding invoice balance by wire transfer. In some regions, you can also pay your outstanding balance by check. See your invoice for more information about paying your outstanding balance. 
  
If you're moving from *credit card or bank account to invoice*, any outstanding balance will be transferred to your next invoice. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you pay by credit card, and your credit card is declined, you'll receive an email letting you know that we were unable to process the payment. You can update your credit card information and immediately submit the payment by using the **Pay now** button on the **Subscriptions** page. For more information, see [What if my credit card was declined and my payment is past due?](pay-for-your-subscription.md#what-if-my-credit-card-was-declined-and-my-payment-is-past-due)

## Change from invoice to credit card or bank account

> [!TIP]
> The following steps apply to individual subscriptions only. If you have multiple subscriptions in your organization, complete these steps for each subscription that you want to change. 
  
When you change from paying by invoice to paying by credit card or bank account, we automatically create a new subscription for you, move your users to the new subscription, and then disable your old subscription. Don't worry, your users won't see a disruption in service and all of their information will be available through the new subscription.
  
1. In the Admin Center, go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Subscriptions</a> page, or choose **Billing**\> **Subscriptions**.
    
2. Choose the subscription that you want to change. In the **Payment details** section, choose **Change payment details**.

When you purchase Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China, you choose either to pay by invoice, or by online payment using Alipay or China UnionPay. You can change your payment method later by calling support and going through the purchasing process again.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If your subscription costs under a certain amount of money (this amount varies by service location), the invoice payment method is not available as an option. If your subscription costs over a certain amount of money, you will have the option to pay by invoice. A credit check may be required for larger invoice payments. 
  
1. Call [the 21Vianet support team](../contact-support-for-business-products.md).
    
2. Wait while the support agent puts your subscription in a "canceled - reduced functionality" or "expired" state. Don't worry, your users will still be able to use their services during this time.
    
3. While on the phone with the service agent, purchase a new subscription and, during checkout, choose the payment method you want to switch to.
    
After you complete these steps, your payment method will be changed and your users will continue to have the same license assignments as before.
