- [Buy a different plan than your trial](#buy-a-different-plan-than-your-trial)
    
## Buy the same plan as your trial

It's easy, and, when you buy the same type of subscription as your trial version, you don't have to worry about losing your data, accounts, and configuration.
  
1. In the Admin center, go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Subscriptions</a> page, or choose **Billing** \> **Subscriptions**.
    
    If you're using Office 365 Germany, go to this <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=847745" target="_blank">Subscriptions</a> page. 
    
    If you're using Office 365 operated by 21Vianet, go to this <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850626" target="_blank">Subscriptions</a> page. 
    
2. On the **Subscriptions** page, select the **Buy now** button for the trial subscription that you want to buy. 
    
3. Complete the steps to check out.
    
## Buy a different plan than your trial
